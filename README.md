# PCA_EigenLetters

In my CS251 data visualization class, I implemented a PCA dimensionality reduction on black-and-white letters to analyze their structure and explore how the dimensionality of the data can be effectively reduced while retaining its most important features.

The goals are to:

- Explore how fundamental transformations affect data: translation, scaling, rotation, projection.
- Analyze and interpret how PCA makes use of transformations to reduce the dimensionality of data.
- Visualize principal component projections and explore the meaning of the data representation.
- Use visualization to guide decisions about data dimensionality reduction.
- Explore two new visualization techniques: elbow plot and loading plot.
